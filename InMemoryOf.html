                    José Nicolás Montañez Useche, born in San Cristóbal, Venezuela, was a dedicated electrical engineer
                    and
                    attorney, as well as a loving father to his daughters, Ericka and Cristal.
                    Known for his kind heart
                    and
                    strong faith, José was a devout Catholic who attended Mass twice daily and offered his time to help
                    at
                    church.

                    His compassion extended to all, whether through caring for people in need, taking in stray cats, or
                    looking after his mother until his final days. José believed in the power of kindness and the
                    importance
                    of community. He was proud of his daughters’ accomplishments and lived a life of humility and grace.

                    We honor his memory and the legacy of love, kindness, and faith he leaves behind.
