                <h2>Transition to Project Leadership (2012 - 2016)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2012, I transitioned to Global Resources as a team lead, focusing on client relations,
                    coordinating development plans, and gathering customer requirements. This role deepened my
                    understanding
                    of project management and strengthened my relationship-building skills with key client stakeholders.

                    In 2013, my career took a new turn when I joined CoolTribes as a Scrum Master. For three years, I
                    embraced agile methodology, managing sprints, retrospectives, and project planning to drive
                    customer-focused outcomes. Working in this agile space taught me how to guide teams toward
                    delivering
                    impactful products quickly and effectively, while also allowing me to cultivate strong
                    organizational and coaching
                    skills.

                <h2>Early Beginnings in Technology (2007 - 2011)</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in a small town in Venezuela, where I pursued my passion for technology and earned a
                    bachelor’s degree in computer science, graduating in 2007.
                    My first job in technology was as a developer at DB ACCESS, where I worked from 2007 to 2011. Using
                    tools like ASP.NET, C#, and SQL Server, I contributed to various projects, including risk management
                    and electronic banking systems.

                <h2>Moving to the United States and Entering Healthcare Interpretation (2016 - 2021)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2016, I moved to the United States to improve my English. By 2018, I began my journey in
                    healthcare
                    interpretation, joining the Asian Association of Utah.

                <h2>Personal Challenges and New Perspectives (2020)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2020, I was diagnosed with breast cancer—a battle that profoundly changed my perspective on life.
                    It shifted my priorities, deepening my appreciation for my family and my relationship with God.

                    In February 2023, I joined University Hospital as a medical interpreter. In June 2023, I was
                    promoted
                    to a leadership role, managing a diverse team of interpreters.
