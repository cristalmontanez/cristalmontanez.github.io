                <h2>Transition to Project Leadership (2012 - 2016)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2012, I transitioned to Global Resources as a team lead, focusing on client relations,
                    coordinating
                    development plans, and gathering customer requirements. This role deepened my understanding of
                    project
                    management and strengthened my relationship-building skills with key client stakeholders.

                    In 2013, my career took a new turn when I joined CoolTribes as a Scrum Master. For three years,
                    I
                    embraced
                    agile methodology, managing sprints, retrospectives, and project planning to drive
                    customer-focused
                    outcomes. I encouraged a learning-focused environment where my team could deliver quality
                    results
                    efficiently. Working in this agile space taught me how to guide teams toward delivering
                    impactful
                    products

                    quickly and effectively, while also allowing me to cultivate strong organizational and coaching
                    skills.

                <h2>Early Beginnings in Technology (2007 - 2011)</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in a small town in Venezuela, where I pursued my passion for technology and earned a
                    bachelor’s
                    degree in computer science, graduating in 2007.
                    My first job in technology was as a developer at DB ACCESS, where I worked from 2007 to 2011. I
                    began as
                    part of the development team, building and enhancing systems for banking clients. Using tools like
                    ASP.NET,
                    C#, and SQL Server, I contributed to a variety of projects, including risk management and electronic
                    banking
                    systems. Later, I moved into my first leadership role, where I planned and supervised complex
                    development
                    tasks. Working in this environment taught me the importance of attention to detail, clear
                    communication,
                    and
                    collaborative problem-solving—skills that laid the foundation for everything that followed.

                <h2>Moving to the United States and Entering Healthcare Interpretation (2016 - 2021)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2016, I moved to the United States to improve my English. By 2018, I began my journey in
                    healthcare
                    interpretation, joining the Asian Association of Utah. Providing interpretation services to
                    connect
                    patients
                    with medical staff was deeply rewarding.

                    From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a PRN interpreter at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, gaining
                    valuable
                    experience by assisting patients in an emotionally sensitive field. I balanced my time between
                    in-person,
                    phone, and video appointments, always maintaining strict confidentiality and professionalism.
                    Each
                    encounter
                    reaffirmed my commitment to compassionate, clear communication.
                </p>

                <h2>Personal Challenges and New Perspectives (2020)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2020, I was diagnosed with breast cancer—a battle that profoundly changed my perspective on
                    life.
                    It
                    shifted my priorities, deepening my appreciation for my family and my relationship with God.
                    Even
                    though
                    my
                    diagnosis was difficult, I am grateful for God’s mercy in giving me a second chance at life.

                </p>
                <h2>Advancing in Medical Interpretation at University Hospital (2023 - Present)
                </h2>

                <p>
                    In February 2023, I joined University Hospital as a medical interpreter, providing verbal
                    interpretation
                    and
                    coordinating patient-staff communications across various settings—whether over the phone, in
                    person,
                    or
                    via
                    video. I prepared records, assisted patients with forms, and adhered strictly to HIPAA laws,
                    which
                    required
                    the utmost discretion and ethical conduct.

                    Most recently, in June 2023, I was promoted to a leadership role at University Hospital. Now, I
                    lead
                    a
                    diverse team of interpreters proficient in Spanish, Arabic, Somali, and Dari. My
                    responsibilities
                    include
                    managing their schedules, overseeing training, and ensuring our services meet the clinic’s
                    unique
                    needs.
                    Working closely with administration, I strive to create an empowering environment for my team,
                    one
                    where
                    patient care and language services align seamlessly.

                    Today, I am proud to bring together my background in technology, agile leadership, and medical
                    interpretation. From developing software to bridging language gaps, my career has always been
                    driven
                    by
                    a
                    dedication to fostering understanding, efficiency, and compassion in every role I undertake.
